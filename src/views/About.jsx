            Hi, ðŸ‘‹ my name is Romin Manogil, <br />
            I'm a young Front-end developer of 32 years old. Although my
            background is not only based in the IT field, I discovered a passion
            for programming. I discovered JavaScript in 2021 for the first time.
            I must confess that was not a really frendly meeting, but we got to
            know each other and now we begin to share beautiful things...
            <br />
            <br />
            Like I said before, my way was strewn with pitfalls. When I was 16
            year old, like every child of this age, I wascompletely lost.
            <br />I practiced karate intensively and my senseÃ¯ wanted me to join
            the national team.
            <br />
            At the same time, I was playing guitar a big part of my free time.
