               Hi, ðŸ‘‹ my name is Romin Manogil, <br />
               I'm a young Front-end developer of 32 years old. Although my
               background is not only based in the IT field, I discovered a
               passion for programming. I discovered JavaScript in 2021 for the
               first time. I must confess that was not a really frendly meeting,
               but we got to know each other and now we begin to share beautiful
               things...
               <br />
               <br />
               Like I said before, my way was strewn with pitfalls. When I was
               16 year old, like every child of this age, I wascompletely lost.
               <br />I practiced karate intensively and my senseÃ¯ wanted me to
               join the national team.
               <br />
               At the same time, I was playing guitar a big part of my free
               time.
            </p>

   );
